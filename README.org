* CreatED hack: The Word of the Lord
This is the repository of mine and [[https://github.com/dylan-thinnes][Dylan's]] project for Edinburgh University Embedded and Robotics Society's CreatED hardware hackathon.

We made two things:
- A Microbit script (freedom.py), where pressing A would scroll a Richard Stallman quote, and pressing B would scroll an Edward Snowden quote. 
- A Raspberry Pi app (app.py), where you would press a button and a random Richard Snowden quote would be read to you using espeak

And there's a presentation in pres.odp showcasing the why / how of the project.
